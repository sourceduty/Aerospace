Martian Lightsabers

The primary mission of Mars 2020 rover involves meticulously collecting Mars rocks and soil, sealing them in tubes, and depositing them at specific surface locations with precise maps for potential future retrieval. In the rover's abdomen, essential equipment like a rotating drill carousel and 43 sample tubes are managed by a small robotic arm. To prevent Earth contamination, "witness tubes" accompany sample tubes, capturing potential contaminants. These witness tubes are opened on the Martian surface to monitor the environment during sample collection. Once collected, samples are stored within the rover until they are strategically placed at designated "sample cache depots" with precise coordinates, allowing for future retrieval and potential return to Earth, ensuring contamination-free Martian material study.

The dirt sample tubes dropped from the Mars 2020 rover look like lightsabers.
