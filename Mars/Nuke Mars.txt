Creating a mission plan that involves setting off a nuclear explosion on Mars to modify its environment is purely speculative and raises significant ethical, legal, and scientific concerns. Current international space law, including the Outer Space Treaty, to which many spacefaring nations are signatories, prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in space. Moreover, the scientific community continues to debate the feasibility and consequences of such drastic measures for terraforming.
