Rover Recovery Mission

Consider the landing sites of the major Mars rover missions: Sojourner (part of the Mars Pathfinder mission in 1997), Spirit and Opportunity (Mars Exploration Rovers, landed in 2004), and Curiosity (Mars Science Laboratory, landed in 2012).

Here are the approximate landing coordinates for each rover:

- Sojourner (Mars Pathfinder): 19.13°N, 33.22°W (Ares Vallis)
- Spirit (MER-A): 14.5684°S, 175.472636°E (Gusev Crater)
- Opportunity (MER-B): 1.9462°S, 354.4734°E (Meridiani Planum)
- Curiosity (MSL): 4.5895°S, 137.4417°E (Gale Crater)

Using these coordinates, we can calculate the great-circle distances between the rovers. This calculation considers the curvature of Mars, which has an average radius of approximately 3,389.5 km. The great-circle distance is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, measured along the surface of the sphere (as opposed to a straight line through the sphere's interior).

- Between Sojourner and Spirit: Approximately 9004 km
- Between Sojourner and Opportunity: Approximately 2036 km
- Between Sojourner and Curiosity: Approximately 9633 km
- Between Spirit and Opportunity: Approximately 9670 km
- Between Spirit and Curiosity: Approximately 2292 km
- Between Opportunity and Curiosity: Approximately 8426 km

These distances highlight the vast areas covered by Mars missions and the logistical challenges involved in planning a rover recovery mission, considering the significant distances between each landing site. ​​

Airborne Concept

A rover recovery mission on Mars, utilizing a helicopter or a modified SkyCrane, would require meticulous planning and innovative engineering solutions. The mission would commence with the deployment of a highly advanced helicopter, designed for the thin Martian atmosphere, or a modified version of the SkyCrane that successfully delivered the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers. This aerial vehicle would need to be equipped with state-of-the-art navigation systems, robust power sources, and a versatile grappling mechanism capable of securely attaching to and lifting the varied designs of the target rovers. The recovery route would be strategically planned to minimize travel distance while navigating around Martian terrain features such as craters, canyons, and dust storm-prone areas.

The mission's first phase would focus on the closest rovers, starting with the pair of Opportunity and Spirit, given their relatively close proximity compared to others. The aerial vehicle would navigate to the Opportunity rover at Meridiani Planum, secure it, and then proceed to the Gusev Crater to recover Spirit. This phase would test the vehicle's operational capabilities, including its lifting power, endurance, and the efficiency of its grappling mechanism. Subsequent phases would target the more distant rovers, with Sojourner and Curiosity being the next priorities. Special attention would be given to optimizing flight paths to conserve energy, taking advantage of prevailing winds, and ensuring safe landings for rover pick-up and drop-off.

Technological advancements, such as improved battery technology or the utilization of nuclear power sources, would be crucial for the success of this mission. The recovery vehicle would also need to be equipped with autonomous systems for navigation and decision-making, given the communication delay between Earth and Mars. This ambitious mission would not only demonstrate the feasibility of Mars surface asset recovery but also pave the way for future missions involving the recycling of hardware and materials, significantly contributing to the sustainability of long-term exploration efforts on the Red Planet.

Cost

Estimating the total cost of a Mars rover recovery mission involving a helicopter or modified SkyCrane is complex and depends on numerous factors including development, manufacturing, testing, and operational aspects. The development of a new aerial vehicle capable of navigating the Martian atmosphere and terrain, equipped with advanced grappling mechanisms and autonomous systems, could easily run into the billions of USD. For context, the Mars Helicopter Ingenuity, a technology demonstrator, cost about $85 million to develop and build, and it is a small, simple rotorcraft compared to what would be needed for a recovery mission.

The modified SkyCrane or helicopter would require significant advancements in propulsion, power, and autonomy technologies. Research, development, and testing of these new systems could increase the mission's cost substantially. Additionally, the cost of launching the mission, which includes the launch vehicle, integration, operations, and mission support, would also be a major component of the total cost. A heavy-lift rocket capable of sending the recovery vehicle to Mars could cost upwards of $150 million to $300 million per launch, depending on the launch provider and the mission's requirements.

Given these considerations, a rough estimate for a Mars rover recovery mission could exceed $1 billion to $3 billion, factoring in the development of the aerial recovery vehicle, launch costs, mission operations, and contingencies. This estimate is speculative and could vary widely based on the mission's final design, the technologies employed, and the extent of the recovery efforts. The mission's unprecedented nature and the technological advancements required would likely place it at the higher end of cost estimates for interplanetary missions.

Time Estimate

The total time estimate for a Mars rover recovery mission involves several phases, each with its own set of complexities and time requirements. The initial phase, focusing on research, development, and testing of the aerial recovery vehicle (helicopter or modified SkyCrane), could span several years. Given the advanced technologies and novel systems required, this phase alone might take 5 to 7 years, considering the iterative design, extensive testing, and validation processes needed to ensure the vehicle's capability to perform under Mars' unique conditions.

Following the development phase, the preparation and launch phase would include final vehicle assembly, integration with the launch vehicle, and pre-launch testing. This phase could take an additional 1 to 2 years, depending on the launch window availability and the readiness of the launch infrastructure. The transit from Earth to Mars, aligning with the optimal launch window to minimize travel time and fuel consumption, takes approximately 6 to 9 months, depending on the specific alignment of Earth and Mars.

Once on Mars, the operational phase of the mission, including navigating to and recovering each rover, would depend heavily on the distances between rovers, the recovery vehicle's speed and operational efficiency, and the Martian environmental conditions. This phase could take anywhere from several months to over a year, especially when factoring in the time required for planning each recovery leg, executing the operations, and dealing with potential Martian challenges such as dust storms. In total, from initial development to the completion of recovery operations on Mars, the mission could span approximately 7 to 10 years.
