The proposed mission involves launching a reusable satellite into a Sun-synchronous orbit approximately 700 km above Earth, with the primary objective of conducting extensive Earth observation over a period of seven years. This mission aims to collect valuable data on climate change, weather patterns, and land use, supporting various global initiatives in climate science, disaster management, and urban planning. Additionally, the mission serves as a platform to test new space technologies including advanced propulsion systems, high-efficiency solar panels, and next-generation communication systems, particularly focusing on the viability of reusing satellite components.

The satellite design is modular, allowing for easier maintenance and the replacement of components, a crucial feature for reusability. It includes a hybrid propulsion system that combines chemical and electric thrusters, high-capacity lithium-ion batteries for energy storage, and sophisticated payloads like multispectral imagers and atmospheric sensors. The incorporation of high-bandwidth laser communication systems ensures rapid data transfer between the satellite and ground stations.

For the launch, a reusable Falcon 9 rocket is considered suitable due to its proven track record and alignment with the sustainability goals of the mission. The launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base allows the satellite to achieve a polar orbit necessary for consistent global coverage and data collection. During its operation, the satellite will perform routine maneuvers to maintain its orbit and activate various instruments based on scheduled data collection needs. Autonomous systems onboard will manage minor anomalies, while more significant issues will be addressed by ground-based mission control.

As the mission approaches its end, a controlled deorbit maneuver will ensure the satellite re-enters Earth's atmosphere, minimizing space debris. The feasibility of refurbishing and reusing satellite components will also be assessed, potentially allowing parts or the entire satellite to be relaunched in future missions.

The estimated cost of such a mission is broken down as follows:
- Satellite Development and Testing: Approximately $150 million, covering design, construction, and ground testing of the satellite and its systems.
- Launch Services: Around $62 million using a Falcon 9 rocket, which includes costs associated with integration, launch operations, and the use of the launch facility.
- Mission Operations and Data Handling: Estimated at $10 million per year, totaling $70 million over seven years, covering ground station operations, data processing, and personnel.
- Deorbit and Recovery Operations: An additional $15 million to manage the end-of-mission deorbit and potential recovery and refurbishment operations.

In total, the mission is projected to cost approximately $297 million. This investment not only advances scientific understanding and technology testing but also sets a precedent for sustainable practices in satellite missions through the reusability of components. The success of this mission could significantly influence future satellite deployment strategies, enhancing the technological capabilities and economic viability of satellite operations worldwide.
