Bioelectricity Generation and Management Module (BGMM) for the ISS

The Bioelectricity Generation and Management Module (BGMM) is a proposed addition to the International Space Station (ISS) that would utilize bioengineering technologies to sustainably generate and manage electricity. By employing microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and algae bioreactors, the module would convert organic waste and metabolic byproducts into bioelectric energy. This innovation would not only provide a supplementary energy source to the ISS but also enhance its resource efficiency by integrating waste recycling into the energy production process. The BGMM would play a pivotal role in advancing bioelectricity research for space applications, contributing to the sustainability of future long-duration missions.

The BGMM's design includes bioreactors, enzymatic fuel cells, and high-capacity energy storage systems, all housed within a 6-meter-long, 4.5-meter-diameter module that conforms to ISS structural standards. The outer shell would consist of aluminum alloy with multilayer insulation for micrometeoroid protection and thermal stability, while the interior would be compartmentalized for optimized bioreactor operation and power system integration. The module would be designed to seamlessly interface with the ISS’s existing power grid, ensuring compatibility with the station’s systems while contributing additional resilience to its energy infrastructure. This setup would also provide opportunities for conducting bioelectric and microbial research in microgravity environments.

Strategically, the BGMM would be attached to one of the six docking ports of the Prichal Node Module on the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) of the ISS. The Prichal ports are ideal for hosting new modules due to their robust connections for power, data, and cooling systems. The BGMM would directly connect to these systems, enabling efficient energy transfer and data integration. Additionally, the Prichal Module’s location provides flexibility for future expansions or modifications to the ISS, ensuring that the BGMM could be easily upgraded or replaced as technology advances.

Beyond its immediate impact on the ISS, the BGMM represents a step toward energy sustainability in space. By reducing reliance on traditional solar arrays and incorporating waste recycling into energy production, the module aligns with long-term goals for creating self-sufficient space habitats. The research conducted within the BGMM could pave the way for bioelectric technologies on lunar bases, Mars habitats, and long-duration interplanetary missions. This innovation underscores the ISS’s role as a platform for testing cutting-edge solutions to the challenges of space exploration, while addressing energy needs in an environmentally sustainable way.
