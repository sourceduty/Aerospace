The International Space Station (ISS) does not fall to Earth because it is in a state of continuous freefall, orbiting the planet at an extremely high speed. The force of Earth's gravity is constantly pulling the ISS downward, just as it does with any object near the planet. However, the station is also moving forward at approximately 28,000 kilometers per hour (17,500 miles per hour). This high velocity causes the station to constantly "miss" the Earth as it falls, creating a stable orbit. Essentially, the ISS is in perpetual motion, balancing between the pull of gravity and its forward momentum, preventing it from crashing to the surface.

Another key factor is the concept of orbital mechanics, which explains how objects in space move in curved paths around celestial bodies. The ISS orbits at an altitude of around 400 kilometers (250 miles), where the force of Earth's gravity is still strong but slightly weaker than on the surface. At this height, the station maintains an equilibrium between gravity and centrifugal force. If its velocity were to decrease significantly, it would start spiraling toward Earth, but if it moved too fast, it would escape into space. To maintain this delicate balance, small rocket thrusters and adjustments are periodically made to keep the ISS in its correct orbit.

Despite being in orbit, the ISS is not completely free from atmospheric drag. Tiny particles and traces of Earth's atmosphere still exert a small force on the station, gradually slowing it down. If left uncorrected, this drag would cause the ISS to lose altitude over time and eventually fall toward Earth. To counteract this, periodic reboost maneuvers are performed using thrusters or docked spacecraft to push the station back to its intended orbit. These adjustments ensure that the ISS remains in a stable orbit for as long as necessary, allowing astronauts to conduct scientific research and maintain a continuous human presence in space.
