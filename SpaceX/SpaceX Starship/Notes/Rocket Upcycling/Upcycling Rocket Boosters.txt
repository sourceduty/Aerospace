Falcon rocket boosters, specifically those used in the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, are designed for reusability. After delivering their payloads into space, the first stage boosters return to Earth and perform a controlled landing, either on land or on a drone ship at sea. This recovery process involves a series of engine burns to slow down the booster, allowing it to re-enter the atmosphere and land upright using deployable landing legs. Once recovered, the booster is inspected, refurbished, and prepared for future launches, dramatically reducing the cost of space travel by avoiding the need to build a new booster for each mission.

The Starship system, developed by SpaceX, takes reusability further. Both the first-stage Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft are designed to be fully reusable. The Super Heavy booster will return to Earth shortly after launch, using its engines for a controlled descent and catching itself on ground-based launch tower arms, eliminating the need for legs. Starship, designed for deep-space missions, will also re-enter Earth's atmosphere and land vertically using its own engines. This full reusability model aims to enable rapid and cost-effective space travel, with the goal of drastically reducing the expense of accessing space and facilitating long-term missions to destinations like the Moon and Mars.

While SpaceXâ€™s current practice is to refurbish and reuse Falcon and Starship boosters, upcycling or repurposing them into other products is not yet a significant part of their operations. The primary goal is to extend the operational life of each booster by refurbishing components after every mission, ensuring they can fly multiple times. However, as boosters age and become unsuitable for further missions, it's possible that parts may be upcycled or recycled into other aerospace systems or research projects, although this would depend on the condition of the hardware and future innovations in aerospace recycling practices.

When Falcon or Starship boosters reach the end of their operational life, they will likely be decommissioned in a process similar to other aerospace hardware. Components that are still functional may be salvaged, while unusable parts could be recycled or disposed of according to environmental standards. With future advancements, there could be opportunities to repurpose these materials, but for now, the focus remains on maximizing their lifespan through refurbishment and reuse in spaceflight, minimizing the environmental impact of space exploration.
