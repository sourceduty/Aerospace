Data science plays a crucial role in various aspects of space science, from analyzing astronomical data to optimizing spacecraft operations. Here are some data science problems relevant to space science:

1. Astronomical Image Analysis: Develop algorithms for processing and analyzing images captured by telescopes and spacecraft. This could involve tasks such as object detection, classification of celestial objects, and identification of transient events like supernovae or asteroids.

2. Exoplanet Detection and Characterization: Use data from telescopes like Kepler, TESS, or upcoming ones to detect exoplanets and characterize their properties such as size, orbit, and composition. Machine learning techniques can be employed for data analysis and pattern recognition.

3. Stellar Spectroscopy: Analyze spectra of stars to infer their chemical composition, temperature, and other physical properties. This could involve developing models to interpret spectroscopic data and classify different types of stars.

4. Gravitational Wave Detection: Develop algorithms for detecting and analyzing gravitational wave signals from sources such as merging black holes and neutron stars. Machine learning techniques can aid in signal processing and classification.

5. Space Weather Prediction: Analyze data from satellites and ground-based instruments to model and predict space weather phenomena such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and geomagnetic storms. This involves time-series analysis and forecasting techniques.

6. Orbital Dynamics and Satellite Tracking: Predict the trajectories of satellites and space debris to avoid collisions and optimize spacecraft operations. Data from ground-based tracking stations and satellite sensors can be used for orbit determination and prediction.

7. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Analysis: Analyze data from telescopes such as the Planck satellite to study the cosmic microwave background radiation, which provides valuable insights into the early universe. This involves statistical analysis and parameter estimation techniques.

8. Astroinformatics: Develop data mining and visualization tools for large-scale astronomical databases, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) or the Virtual Observatory (VO), to facilitate exploration and discovery.

9. Spacecraft Health Monitoring: Analyze telemetry data from spacecraft to monitor their health status, detect anomalies, and predict potential failures. This involves anomaly detection algorithms and predictive maintenance techniques.

10. Planetary Exploration and Rover Operations: Develop algorithms for autonomous navigation and decision-making for planetary rovers based on data from onboard sensors and orbital imagery. This involves machine learning for terrain analysis and path planning.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more data science challenges in space science waiting to be explored.
