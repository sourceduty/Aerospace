A new theory, called the Cyclical Exchange Theory, proposes that the universe operates in a dynamic state of expansion and contraction driven by the continuous birth and death of celestial bodies rather than a one-time Big Bang or ongoing exponential expansion. According to this theory, instead of an ever-expanding universe as suggested by the Big Bang and dark energy models, the universe is in a constant flux, where the creation of new stars, galaxies, and other cosmic structures leads to periods of expansion, while the death of celestial bodies, such as the collapse of stars into black holes, leads to contraction. Over time, the universe grows larger or smaller based on the balance of these processes, making its overall size and state variable rather than linear or one-directional.

In this theory, the expansion observed today is merely a temporary phase in the universe’s long-term cycle. The universe could have been smaller in the past when fewer new celestial bodies were forming or during periods when black holes and other dense objects were more dominant. As new stars and galaxies form, they push matter outward, creating an observable expansion. However, as these stars reach the end of their life cycles and collapse into black holes or neutron stars, they pull matter inward, triggering a phase of contraction. This cyclical nature challenges the idea of dark energy as the primary driver of universal expansion, suggesting instead that gravity from dense, dead objects plays an equally important role in pulling matter back together in the universe.

If this theory holds true, the universe could contract again in the future, potentially becoming smaller or denser as more celestial bodies die off and condense into black holes. The universe’s ultimate fate, then, would depend on the interplay between expansion driven by new stellar formation and contraction caused by the collapse of aging cosmic bodies. This cyclical process implies that the universe may go through infinite cycles of expansion and contraction, making the Big Bang just one event in a much larger cosmic rhythm rather than the singular beginning of all things. The Cyclical Exchange Theory provides a new lens through which to view the universe, emphasizing a balanced, oscillating system over the idea of a universe moving inexorably toward infinite expansion.
