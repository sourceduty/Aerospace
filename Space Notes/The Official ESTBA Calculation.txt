Official ESTBA Calculation

E = Elon Musk's energy (in gigawatts)
S = SpaceX's rocket launches per year
T = Tesla's electric cars produced per month
B = Boring Company's tunnels (measured in miles per month)
A = Average number of tweets by Elon per day

Then the equation for the Musk Multiverse might be:

E = (S * T^2) / (B + A)

Where:

- If S = 50 (SpaceX launches 50 rockets a year)
- T = 20,000 (Tesla produces 20,000 cars per month)
- B = 1.5 (Boring Company completes 1.5 miles of tunnel per month)
- A = 10 (Elon tweets 10 times a day on average)

Plugging in the numbers:

E = (50 * 20,000^2) / (1.5 + 10)
E = (50 * 400,000,000) / 11.5
E â‰ˆ 1,739,130,435 gigawatts

Elon Musk's energy would be approximately 1.74 billion gigawatts, which seems about right for someone who's revolutionizing space travel, electric cars, tunneling, and social media simultaneously.
