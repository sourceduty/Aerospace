The computers aboard the International Space Station (ISS) form a highly intricate network that supports a range of critical functions necessary for the station’s operation, from life support to communication with mission control on Earth. At the heart of this system are the ruggedized Command and Control Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (C&C MDM) computers, which, despite their relatively low computational power — based on Intel 80386SX processors running at just 20 MHz with only a few megabytes of RAM — are highly reliable and resilient in the challenging space environment. These radiation-hardened units, roughly the size of a large suitcase, manage essential systems like station orientation, environmental controls, and power distribution. The choice to use older, simpler technology over cutting-edge hardware stems from the need to withstand the extreme conditions of space, where cosmic radiation and temperature fluctuations could render more modern systems vulnerable. The focus on reliability ensures that the station's critical functions remain operational without compromising crew safety or mission success. Additionally, redundancy is built into the system, with multiple C&C computers operating in parallel — a primary unit, a backup, and a standby — ensuring that if one unit fails, another can immediately take over.

In addition to these essential systems, laptops play a crucial role on the ISS, supporting activities ranging from scientific research to communication with Earth. Astronauts initially used IBM ThinkPad laptops, starting with models like the ThinkPad 760XD, and later transitioned to more powerful machines such as the ThinkPad T61p and T420. In recent years, the ISS has upgraded to HP ZBook 15s, durable, high-performance laptops that run customized versions of Windows 10 and Linux. These laptops serve as indispensable tools for astronauts, enabling them to monitor experiments, file reports, send emails, and engage in educational outreach with students on Earth. They are also modified to accommodate the challenges of microgravity, featuring specialized cooling systems and shielding to protect against radiation-induced errors. The ISS maintains a sophisticated onboard network called OpsLAN to connect these laptops to the station’s core systems, ensuring secure and reliable communication between modules. Beyond their technical functions, these computers also support the mental health and morale of astronauts, offering them a way to stay connected with family and engage in recreational activities like watching movies, playing games, and listening to music. As human exploration ventures further into the solar system, the ISS’s legacy of rugged, reliable computing will undoubtedly influence the design of future spaceborne technology.

Designing a rover capable of salvaging previous rovers is notably more expensive than creating a standard rover. The increased cost stems from the complexity of the technology, requiring advanced robotics, sensors, and specialized tools. Extensive research and development efforts, including customization for specific missions and target rovers, contribute to the higher expenses. Rigorous testing, integration, redundancy, and potential human involvement further elevate the overall cost.

Despite the greater upfront investment, the benefits of resource recovery and sustainability in future missions may justify these expenses. Salvage rovers have the potential to recycle valuable materials and components, reducing the need for new resources and minimizing waste. The decision to develop a salvage-capable rover should be carefully weighed against the associated costs and mission objectives to determine its feasibility and value.
